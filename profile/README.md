### Our mission
Our mission is to create a movie entirely crowdsourced by contributors, with no copyright, and licensed under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, giving people who want to redisturbute the movie more leeway to do what they want with the movie, as long as if it's allowed under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.
